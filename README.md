# CSS Specificity and Inheritance Bug

This repository demonstrates a rare CSS bug related to specificity and inheritance.  Under certain circumstances, the expected cascading order of CSS rules may not behave as anticipated, leading to unexpected rendering of colors.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS, while `bugSolution.css` offers a potential solution. The issue highlights the sometimes unpredictable nature of CSS inheritance when dealing with complex selector specificity.

This is a non-standard case related to browser engine implementations.  It's important to note that not all browsers will reproduce this issue. It serves to illustrate a potential edge-case to be aware of during CSS development.
